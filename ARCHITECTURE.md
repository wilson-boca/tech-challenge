# Achitecture Design

## Architecture Overview
Justification for the technology coices:

### API Layer
- **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs\
  Why FastAPI? Benchmarks show it's three times faster than Django and fifteen times faster than Flask, making it perfect for high-performance requirements.

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with read replicas\
  Why read replicas? The API uses read replicas to distribute database load, significantly improving read performance and reducing response times.

### Caching Layer
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching\
  Why Redis? As an in-memory database, Redis provides the fastest possible data retrieval, perfect for caching frequently accessed data and improving response times.

### Message Queue
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for asynchronous processing\
  Why messaging? To guarantee response times under 500ms, POST requests are processed asynchronously through a message queue, allowing immediate response to the client.

### Containerization & Orchestration
- **Docker**: Container platform for consistent deployments\
  Why Docker? It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production, making deployments reliable and reproducible.

- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform\
  Why Kubernetes? It provides automatic scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities, essential for maintaining performance under high load.

## Performance Optimizations
1. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis for hot data
   - Cache invalidation patterns
   - TTL-based cache expiration

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Connection pooling
   - Indexed queries
   - Efficient data models
   - Read replicas

3. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - RabbitMQ for message queuing
   - Background task processing
   - Non-blocking operations

4. **Load Handling**
   - Rate limiting
   - Circuit breakers to external repositories
   - Graceful shutdown
